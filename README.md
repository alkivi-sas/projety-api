# Alkivi ProjectY API

This repository contains the code for the API.

## Requirements

You should install this dependencies (debian)

    apt-get install libyaml-dev libzmq-dev python-virtualenv libpython-dev

## Installation

Python 2.7+ only because of salt compatibility.

As usual, create a virtual environment and install the requirements with pip.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

A broker for messages in necessary, default to redis (rabbitmq to come)

    apt-get install redis-server

## Salt Master configuration

If you want all the service using a regular user, you need to changes the user who runs the salt-master.
Check https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/nonroot.html for more info.
We are assuming saltuser is running the master in the following

### In details

Add the user in /etc/salt/master

    cat /etc/salt/master | grep 'user:'
    user: saltuser

Then chown right files

    chown -R saltuser /etc/salt /var/cache/salt /var/log/salt /var/run/salt


## Detailed installation

All is done using a standart user.

### Clone repo and install virtualenvyy

    git clone git@git.alkivi.fr:alkivi/projety-api.git ~/projety-api
    cd ~/projety-api
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install git-hooks

At every commit, we check for lint and test errors.

    cd ~/projety-api
    ./git-hooks/create-hook-symlinks

## Running

There is two components. First the server to dispatch request

    python manage.py runserver

At this time, bug with salt in debug mode so run the server using gunicorn

    ./webserver/gunicorn-eventlet.sh

The second component of this application is the Celery workers, which must be
started with the following command:

    python manage.py celery


##  Usage

### Before start

You need to create a new user

    python manage.py createuser awesome_user

The password will then be displayed on the command line
If you already have a user, you can do it again, it will display a valid token

### Basic : Authentification

By default listen on localhost port 5000. I'll defined the url as:

    URL='http://127.0.0.1:5000'

Get a token

    curl -i -X POST \
        -u 'user:password' \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/tokens

Use the token then to get user

    TOKEN='previous_token'
    curl -i -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/users

### List availables minions

    curl -i -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/minions

### Ping machines (salt ping)

#### Ping one minion synchronously

    curl -i -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/minions/<minion_from_keys>/ping

#### Ping a list minion synchronously

    curl -X POST -i \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        -d '{"target":["minion1","minion2"]}' \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/ping

#### Ping one minion asynchronously

    curl -i -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/tasks/ping/<minion_from_keys>

#### Ping a list minion asynchronously

    curl -X POST -i \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        -d '{"target":["minion1","minion2"]}' \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/tasksping

## Working with asynchronous request

When performing and asynchronous request, you will get a 202.
In the response, there is a header location.
Use this location using GET, you will get a 202 until the end
of the request and then the response.

Example with async ping

    curl -i -X POST \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
         ${URL}/api/v1.0/tasks/ping/my_awesome_minion

In the answer you will get

    HTTP/1.1 202 ACCEPTED
    Server: gunicorn/19.6.0
    Date: Fri, 12 Aug 2016 08:37:24 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    Location: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/tasks/status/a1d652eb-0311-49b9-abbe-aa141ddd7447
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 0

Now just get the location 

    curl -i \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        ${URL}/api/v1.0/tasks/status/a1d652eb-0311-49b9-abbe-aa141ddd7447

And you'll get full answer

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: gunicorn/19.6.0
    Date: Fri, 12 Aug 2016 08:39:01 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 50

    {
      "my_awesome_minion": true
    }

## Testing the API

Check https://swagger.alkivi.fr and points to /api/v1.0/spec of the API url.
You will be able to get a token (using authorization basic).
Once you'll have a token, use Bearer ${TOKEN} in the token authorization
